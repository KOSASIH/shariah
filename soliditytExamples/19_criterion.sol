19. Responsibility and accountability:
    - Each party should clearly outline their responsibilities and be held accountable for their actions under the contract.
    - Example: A construction contract where the contractor is not held accountable for substandard work.
    - Solidity Example:
      ```solidity
      // Compliant: Accountable construction contract
      contract Construction {
          address public contractor;
          address public client;
          uint256 public budget;
          string public projectDescription;
```solidity// Compliant: Accountable construction contract
      contract Construction {
          address public contractor;
          address public client;
          uint256 public budget;
          string public projectDescription;
```
