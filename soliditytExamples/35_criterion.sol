35. Protection of minority rights:
    - The contract should ensure the protection of minority rights within business entities, such as in partnerships or joint ventures.
    - Example: A partnership agreement that unfairly limits the rights and profits of minority partners.
    - Solidity Example:
      ```solidity
      // Compliant: Protection of minority rights
      contract PartnershipRights {
          address public majorityPartner;
          address public minorityPartner;
          uint256 public capitalMajority;
          uint256 public capitalMinority;
          uint256 public profitShareMajority;
          uint256 public profitShareMinority;
```solidity// Compliant: Protection of minority rights
      contract PartnershipRights {
          address public majorityPartner;
          address public minorityPartner;
          uint256 public capitalMajority;
          uint256 public capitalMinority;
          uint256 public profitShareMajority;
          uint256 public profitShareMinority;
```
