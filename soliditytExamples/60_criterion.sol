60. Fair treatment of consumers:
    - Consumer contracts should ensure fair treatment, transparency, and the provision of accurate information.
    - Example: A sales contract where the seller provides misleading information about the product.
    - Solidity Example:
      ```solidity
      // Compliant: Fair treatment of consumers
      contract ConsumerProtection {
          address public seller;
          address public buyer;
          string public productDescription;
```solidity// Compliant: Fair treatment of consumers
      contract ConsumerProtection {
          address public seller;
          address public buyer;
          string public productDescription;
```
