64. Adherence to ethical labor practices:
    - Contracts involving labor should adhere to ethical labor practices, including fair wages and working conditions.
    - Example: A labor contract that does not comply with labor laws or ethical standards for worker treatment.
    - Solidity Example:
      ```solidity
      // Compliant: Ethical labor practices
      contract LaborContract {
          address public employer;
          address public worker;
          uint256 public wage;
          uint256 public workingHours;
```solidity// Compliant: Ethical labor practices
      contract LaborContract {
          address public employer;
          address public worker;
          uint256 public wage;
          uint256 public workingHours;
```
