44. Conditions of contract (shurut):
    - The contract should include all necessary conditions to make it valid and enforceable under Islamic law.

    - Solidity Example:
      ```solidity
      // Compliant: Clear conditions of contract
      contract SalesContract {
          address public seller;
          address public buyer;
          uint256 public price;
          uint256 public deliveryDate;
```solidity// Compliant: Clear conditions of contract
      contract SalesContract {
          address public seller;
          address public buyer;
          uint256 public price;
