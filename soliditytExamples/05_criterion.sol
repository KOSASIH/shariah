5. The contract must ensure justice and fairness: 
    - The terms of the contract should be fair to all parties involved and should not result in unjust enrichment or exploitation.
    - Example: An employment contract where the employee's wages are significantly below market rates without a justifiable reason.
    - Solidity Example:
      ```solidity
      // Compliant: Fair employment contract
      contract Employment {
          address public employer;
          address public employee;
          uint256 public salary;
```solidity// Compliant: Fair employment contract
      contract Employment {
          address public employer;
          address public employee;
          uint256 public salary;
```
