61. Proper execution of contracts (ijab and qabul):
    - The contract should be executed with a proper offer and acceptance.
    - Example: A contract where the acceptance is not clearly communicated or documented.
    - Solidity Example:
      ```solidity
      // Compliant: Proper offer and acceptance
      contract ProperContract {
          address public party1;
          address public party2;
          bool public offer;
          bool public acceptance;
```solidity// Compliant: Proper offer and acceptance
      contract ProperContract {
          address public party1;
          address public party2;
          bool public offer;
          bool public acceptance;
```
