14. Profit and loss sharing:
    - In partnership agreements, profits and losses should be shared according to the agreed-upon ratio, and not in a manner that disproportionately benefits one party.
    - Example: A partnership where one partner unfairly receives a fixed profit regardless of the business performance.
    - Solidity Example:
      ```solidity
      // Compliant: Fair profit and loss sharing
      contract Partnership {
          address public partner1;
          address public partner2;
          uint256 public capital1;
          uint256 public capital2;
          uint256 public profitShare1;
          uint256 public profitShare2;
```solidity// Compliant: Fair profit and loss sharing
      contract Partnership {
          address public partner1;
          address public partner2;
          uint256 public capital1;
          uint256 public capital2;
          uint256 public profitShare1;
          uint256 public profitShare2;
```
