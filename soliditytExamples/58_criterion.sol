58. Clear succession planning:
    - Contracts involving partnerships or family businesses should include clear succession planning to avoid disputes.
    - Example: A family business agreement that does not specify how shares will be distributed upon the death of a partner.
    - Solidity Example:
      ```solidity
      // Compliant: Clear succession planning
      contract FamilyBusiness {
          address public owner;
          address public successor;
          uint256 public shares;
```solidity// Compliant: Clear succession planning
      contract FamilyBusiness {
          address public owner;
          address public successor;
          uint256 public shares;
```
