65. Transparency in financial reporting:
    - Contracts involving financial transactions should include requirements for transparent and accurate financial reporting.
    - Example: A business contract where financial statements are not regularly audited or disclosed to partners.
    - Solidity Example:
      ```solidity
      // Compliant: Transparent financial reporting
      contract FinancialReporting {
          address public owner;
          mapping(uint256 => string) public financialStatements;
```solidity// Compliant: Transparent financial reporting
      contract FinancialReporting {
          address public owner;
          mapping(uint256 => string) public financialStatements;
```
