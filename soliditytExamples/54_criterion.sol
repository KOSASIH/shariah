54. Proper due diligence:
    - All parties should conduct proper due diligence to ensure the contract is fair and compliant with Shariah.
    - Example: A merger agreement where one company fails to disclose significant liabilities to the other party.
    - Solidity Example:
      ```solidity
      // Compliant: Proper due diligence in merger agreement
      contract MergerAgreement {
          address public company1;
          address public company2;
          string public disclosedLiabilities;
```solidity// Compliant: Proper due diligence in merger agreement
      contract MergerAgreement {
          address public company1;
          address public company2;
          string public disclosedLiabilities;
```
