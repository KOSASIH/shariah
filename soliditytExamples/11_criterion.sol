11. Clarity in compensation:
    - The compensation or remuneration for services or goods provided must be clearly defined and agreed upon by all parties.
    - Example: A service contract where the payment terms are vague or open to interpretation.
    - Solidity Example:
      ```solidity
      // Compliant: Clear compensation agreement
      contract ServiceContract {
          address public provider;
          address public client;
          uint256 public fee;
```solidity// Compliant: Clear compensation agreement
      contract ServiceContract {
          address public provider;
          address public client;
          uint256 public fee;
```
