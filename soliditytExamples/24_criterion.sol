24. Prohibition of oppressive terms:
    - The contract should not include terms that are oppressive or excessively one-sided.
    - Example: A lease agreement where the landlord imposes excessively high penalties for minor infractions by the tenant.
    - Solidity Example:
      ```solidity
      // Not compliant: Oppressive lease terms
      contract OppressiveLease {
          address public landlord;
          address public tenant;
          uint256 public rent;
          uint256 public penalty;
```solidity// Not compliant: Oppressive lease terms
      contract OppressiveLease {
          address public landlord;
          address public tenant;
          uint256 public rent;
          uint256 public penalty;
```
