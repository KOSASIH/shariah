22. Avoidance of excessive uncertainty in delivery or performance:
    - The contract must clearly specify the terms of delivery and performance to avoid uncertainty.
    - Example: A service contract that does not specify the exact timeline or milestones for completion.
    - Solidity Example:
      ```solidity
      // Compliant: Clear delivery and performance terms
      contract ServiceDelivery {
          address public provider;
          address public client;
          uint256 public fee;
          string public serviceDescription;
          uint256 public deliveryTime;
```solidity// Compliant: Clear delivery and performance terms
      contract ServiceDelivery {
          address public provider;
          address public client;
          uint256 public fee;
          string public serviceDescription;
          uint256 public deliveryTime;
```
