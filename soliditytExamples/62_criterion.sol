62. Equitable distribution of assets:
    - In dissolution of partnerships, assets should be distributed equitably among partners.
    - Example: A partnership dissolution agreement where one partner unfairly receives a larger share of the assets.
    - Solidity Example:
      ```solidity
      // Compliant: Equitable asset distribution
      contract Dissolution {
          address public partner1;
          address public partner2;
          uint256 public assets;
          uint256 public share1;
          uint256 public share2;
```solidity// Compliant: Equitable asset distribution
      contract Dissolution {
          address public partner1;
          address public partner2;
          uint256 public assets;
          uint256 public share1;
          uint256 public share2;
```
