52. Avoidance of unjust monopolies (ihtikar):
    - The contract should not create unjust monopolies that exploit consumers.
    - Example: An exclusive supply agreement that prevents other suppliers from entering the market.
    - Solidity Example:
      ```solidity
      // Not compliant: Unjust monopoly
      contract UnjustMonopoly {
          address public supplier;
          address public exclusiveBuyer;
          uint256 public price;
```solidity// Not compliant: Unjust monopoly
      contract UnjustMonopoly {
          address public supplier;
          address public exclusiveBuyer;
          uint256 public price;
```
