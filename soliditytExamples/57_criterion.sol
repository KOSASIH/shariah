57. Prohibition of short selling:
    - The contract should avoid short selling practices that involve selling borrowed assets.
    - Example: A trading contract where a party sells shares they have borrowed in anticipation of buying them back at a lower price.
    - Solidity Example:
      ```solidity
      // Not compliant: Short selling contract
      contract ShortSelling {
          address public seller;
          address public lender;
          uint256 public borrowedShares;
          uint256 public sellPrice;
```solidity// Not compliant: Short selling contract
      contract ShortSelling {
          address public seller;
          address public lender;
          uint256 public borrowedShares;
          uint256 public sellPrice;
```
