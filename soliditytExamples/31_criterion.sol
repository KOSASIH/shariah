31. No compulsion in business transactions:
    - All business transactions within the contract must be entered into voluntarily and without compulsion.
    - Example: A sales contract where one party is forced to sell their property under duress.
    - Solidity Example:
      ```solidity
      // Compliant: Voluntary business transaction
      contract VoluntarySale {
          address public seller;
          address public buyer;
          uint256 public price;
```solidity// Compliant: Voluntary business transaction
      contract VoluntarySale {
          address public seller;
          address public buyer;
          uint256 public price;
```
