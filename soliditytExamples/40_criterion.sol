40. Clear definition of roles and responsibilities:
    - The contract should clearly define the roles and responsibilities of all parties to prevent misunderstandings.
    - Example: A partnership agreement that outlines the specific duties and contributions of each partner.
    - Solidity Example:
      ```solidity
      // Compliant: Clear roles and responsibilities
      contract PartnershipRoles {
          address public partner1;
          address public partner2;
          string public role1;
          string public role2;
```solidity// Compliant: Clear roles and responsibilities
      contract PartnershipRoles {
          address public partner1;
          address public partner2;
          string public role1;
          string public role2;
```
