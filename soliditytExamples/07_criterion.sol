7. Transparency and disclosure:
    - All terms, conditions, and risks involved in the contract must be clearly disclosed to all parties.
    - Example: A financial investment agreement where all potential risks and rewards are fully explained to the investor.
    - Solidity Example:
      ```solidity
      // Compliant: Transparent investment agreement
      contract Investment {
          address public investor;
          uint256 public investmentAmount;
          string public riskDisclosure;
```solidity// Compliant: Transparent investment agreement
      contract Investment {
          address public investor;
          uint256 public investmentAmount;
          string public riskDisclosure;
```
