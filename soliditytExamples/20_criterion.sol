20. Prohibition of interest-based financial products:
    - The contract should not involve interest-based financial products such as conventional bonds or savings accounts.
    - Example: A corporate bond that pays fixed interest to bondholders.
    - Solidity Example:
      ```solidity
      // Not compliant: Interest-based corporate bond
      contract CorporateBond {
          address public issuer;
          address public bondholder;
          uint256 public principal;
          uint256 public interestRate;
```solidity// Not compliant: Interest-based corporate bond
      contract CorporateBond {
          address public issuer;
          address public bondholder;
          uint256 public principal;
          uint256 public interestRate;
```
