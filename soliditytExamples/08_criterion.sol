8. Mutual consent:
    - All parties must willingly and knowingly consent to the contract without any form of coercion or undue influence.
    - Example: A contract signed under duress or with significant pressure from one party.
    - Solidity Example:
      ```solidity
      // Compliant: Consent-based contract
      contract ConsentContract {
          address public party1;
          address public party2;
          bool public consent1;
          bool public consent2;
```solidity// Compliant: Consent-based contract
      contract ConsentContract {
          address public party1;
          address public party2;
          bool public consent1;
          bool public consent2;
```
