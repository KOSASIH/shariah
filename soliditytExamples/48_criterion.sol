48. Fair treatment of employees:
    - Employment contracts should ensure fair treatment, wages, and working conditions.
    - Example: An employment contract that requires excessive working hours without adequate compensation or rest periods.
    - Solidity Example:
      ```solidity
      // Compliant: Fair employment contract
      contract FairEmployment {
          address public employer;
          address public employee;
          uint256 public salary;
          uint256 public workingHours;
```solidity// Compliant: Fair employment contract
      contract FairEmployment {
          address public employer;
          address public employee;
          uint256 public salary;
          uint256 public workingHours;
```
