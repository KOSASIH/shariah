2. No involvement in maysir (gambling): 
    - The contract must not involve any forms of gambling or speculative transactions.
    - Example: A contract that includes clauses for betting on uncertain future events, such as stock price movements.
    - Solidity Example:
      ```solidity
      // Not compliant: Betting contract
      contract Betting {
          address public bettor1;
          address public bettor2;
          uint256 public betAmount;
          uint256 public winningNumber;
```solidity// Not compliant: Betting contract
      contract Betting {
          address public bettor1;
          address public bettor2;
          uint256 public betAmount;
          uint256 public winningNumber;
```
