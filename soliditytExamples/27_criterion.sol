27. Proper documentation and record-keeping:
    - The contract should require proper documentation and record-keeping to ensure transparency and accountability.
    - Example: A financial contract that mandates regular audits and detailed financial reporting.
    - Solidity Example:
      ```solidity
      // Compliant: Proper documentation and record-keeping
      contract Documentation {
          address public owner;
          mapping(uint256 => string) public records;
```solidity// Compliant: Proper documentation and record-keeping
      contract Documentation {
          address public owner;
          mapping(uint256 => string) public records;
```
