6. No unethical exploitation: 
    - The contract should not exploit any party's lack of knowledge, desperation, or weakness.
    - Example: A contract with excessively high penalties for late payments, taking advantage of a party's financial difficulties.
    - Solidity Example:
      ```solidity
      // Not compliant: Exploitative contract with high penalties
      contract ExploitativeContract {
          uint256 public penalty;
          address public debtor;
```solidity// Not compliant: Exploitative contract with high penalties
      contract ExploitativeContract {
          uint256 public penalty;
          address public debtor;
```
