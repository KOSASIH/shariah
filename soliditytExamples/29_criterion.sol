29. Avoidance of interest-based derivatives:
    - The contract should not involve derivatives or financial instruments that are based on interest.
    - Example: A contract involving interest rate swaps or options based on interest-bearing assets.
    - Solidity Example:
      ```solidity
      // Not compliant: Interest-based derivative contract
      contract InterestRateSwap {
          address public party1;
          address public party2;
          uint256 public interestRate1;
          uint256 public interestRate2;
```solidity// Not compliant: Interest-based derivative contract
      contract InterestRateSwap {
          address public party1;
          address public party2;
          uint256 public interestRate1;
          uint256 public interestRate2;
```
