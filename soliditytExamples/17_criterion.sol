17. No exploitation of natural resources in a harmful manner:
    - The contract should not involve the exploitation of natural resources in a way that causes significant harm to the environment.
    - Example: A mining contract that does not include measures to prevent environmental degradation.
    - Solidity Example:
      ```solidity
      // Not compliant: Environmentally harmful mining contract
      contract HarmfulMining {
          address public miner;
          string public miningArea;
```solidity// Not compliant: Environmentally harmful mining contract
      contract HarmfulMining {
          address public miner;
          string public miningArea;
```
