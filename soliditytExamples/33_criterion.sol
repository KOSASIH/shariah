33. Avoidance of unfair trade practices:
    - The contract should not involve unfair trade practices, such as monopolistic behavior or price-fixing.
    - Example: A supply contract where the supplier agrees to sell only to certain buyers at inflated prices.
    - Solidity Example:
      ```solidity
      // Not compliant: Unfair trade practices
      contract UnfairTrade {
          address public supplier;
          address public buyer;
          uint256 public price;
```solidity// Not compliant: Unfair trade practices
      contract UnfairTrade {
          address public supplier;
          address public buyer;
          uint256 public price;
```
