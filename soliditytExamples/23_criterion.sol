23. No unfair termination clauses:
    - The contract should not have clauses that allow one party to terminate the agreement unfairly or without just cause.
    - Example: An employment contract that allows the employer to terminate the employee at any time without reason or compensation.
    - Solidity Example:
      ```solidity
      // Compliant: Fair termination clauses
      contract EmploymentContract {
          address public employer;
          address public employee;
          uint256 public salary;
```solidity// Compliant: Fair termination clauses
      contract EmploymentContract {
          address public employer;
          address public employee;
          uint256 public salary;
```
