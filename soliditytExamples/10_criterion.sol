10. Avoidance of conflict of interest:
    - Parties involved in the contract must avoid situations where their personal interests conflict with their duties and obligations under the contract.
    - Example: A procurement officer awarding a contract to a company they own shares in without disclosing this interest.
    - Solidity Example:
      ```solidity
      // Not compliant: Conflict of interest in awarding contracts
      contract Procurement {
          address public officer;
          address public vendor;
          bool public conflictOfInterest;
```solidity// Not compliant: Conflict of interest in awarding contracts
      contract Procurement {
          address public officer;
          address public vendor;
          bool public conflictOfInterest;
```
