46. No unjust enrichment:
    - The contract should not result in unjust enrichment of one party at the expense of another.
    - Example: A loan agreement where the lender gains significantly more than the principal amount lent without any justification.
    - Solidity Example:
      ```solidity
      // Not compliant: Unjust enrichment in loan agreement
      contract UnjustEnrichment {
          address public lender;
          address public borrower;
          uint256 public principal;
          uint256 public unjustGain;
```solidity// Not compliant: Unjust enrichment in loan agreement
      contract UnjustEnrichment {
          address public lender;
          address public borrower;
          uint256 public principal;
          uint256 public unjustGain;
```
