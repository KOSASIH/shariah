55. Avoidance of coercion and duress (ikrah):
    - The contract must be entered into freely without any form of coercion or duress.
    - Example: Forcing a party to sign a contract under threat of harm.
    - Solidity Example:
      ```solidity
      // Compliant: Voluntary contract
      contract VoluntaryContract {
          address public party1;
          address public party2;
          bool public consent1;
          bool public consent2;
```solidity// Compliant: Voluntary contract
      contract VoluntaryContract {
          address public party1;
          address public party2;
          bool public consent1;
          bool public consent2;
```
