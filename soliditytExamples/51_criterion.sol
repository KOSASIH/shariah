51. No involvement in usurious practices (riba al-fadl):
    - The contract should avoid practices where one party gains an undue advantage over another.
    - Example: A sale contract involving the exchange of unequal amounts of the same commodity.
    - Solidity Example:
      ```solidity
      // Not compliant: Usurious practice in sale contract
      contract UsuriousSale {
          address public seller;
          address public buyer;
          uint256 public amount1;
          uint256 public amount2;
```solidity// Not compliant: Usurious practice in sale contract
      contract UsuriousSale {
          address public seller;
          address public buyer;
          uint256 public amount1;
          uint256 public amount2;
```
