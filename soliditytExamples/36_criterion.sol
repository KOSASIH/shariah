36. Fair pricing mechanisms:
    - The contract should include fair pricing mechanisms that are transparent and justifiable.
    - Example: A service contract where the pricing is based on a clear and fair cost structure rather than arbitrary fees.
    - Solidity Example:
      ```solidity
      // Compliant: Transparent pricing mechanisms
      contract ServicePricing {
          address public provider;
          address public client;
          uint256 public cost;
          uint256 public markup;
```solidity// Compliant: Transparent pricing mechanisms
      contract ServicePricing {
          address public provider;
          address public client;
          uint256 public cost;
          uint256 public markup;
```
