63. Avoidance of conditions leading to disputes:
    - The contract should avoid conditions that are likely to lead to disputes and disagreements.
    - Example: Ambiguous terms in a rental agreement regarding maintenance responsibilities.
    - Solidity Example:
      ```solidity
      // Compliant: Clear terms to avoid disputes
      contract RentalAgreement {
          address public landlord;
          address public tenant;
          uint256 public rent;
          string public maintenanceResponsibilities;
```solidity// Compliant: Clear terms to avoid disputes
      contract RentalAgreement {
          address public landlord;
          address public tenant;
          uint256 public rent;
          string public maintenanceResponsibilities;
```
