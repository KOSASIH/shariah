41. No speculative sales (baiâ€™ al-gharar):
    - The contract should not involve sales of items that do not exist or cannot be delivered.
    - Example: Selling goods that the seller does not own or have the ability to deliver at the time of the contract.
    - Solidity Example:
      ```solidity
      // Not compliant: Speculative sales contract
      contract SpeculativeSales {
          address public seller;
          address public buyer;
          string public goods;
          bool public owned;
```solidity// Not compliant: Speculative sales contract
      contract SpeculativeSales {
          address public seller;
          address public buyer;
          string public goods;
          bool public owned;
```
