50. Transparency in partnership agreements:
    - All terms of the partnership should be transparent and agreed upon by all partners.

      ```solidity
      // Compliant: Transparent partnership agreement
      contract TransparentPartnership {
          address public partner1;
          address public partner2;
          mapping(address => string) public financialInformation;
```solidity// Compliant: Transparent partnership agreement
      contract TransparentPartnership {
          address public partner1;
          address public partner2;
