32. Fair profit margins:
    - The contract should ensure that profit margins are fair and justifiable, avoiding excessive markups.
    - Example: A resale contract where the resale price is significantly higher than the market value without justification.
    - Solidity Example:
      ```solidity
      // Compliant: Fair profit margins
      contract FairPricing {
          address public seller;
          address public buyer;
          uint256 public originalPrice;
          uint256 public resalePrice;
```solidity// Compliant: Fair profit margins
      contract FairPricing {
          address public seller;
          address public buyer;
          uint256 public originalPrice;
          uint256 public resalePrice;
```
