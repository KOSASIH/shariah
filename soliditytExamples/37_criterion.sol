37. Avoidance of ambiguity in financial terms:
    - All financial terms and obligations should be clearly defined to avoid ambiguity.
    - Example: A loan agreement where the repayment schedule and amounts are not clearly specified.
    - Solidity Example:
      ```solidity
      // Compliant: Clear financial terms
      contract LoanAgreement {
          address public lender;
          address public borrower;
          uint256 public principal;
          uint256 public repaymentAmount;
          uint256 public dueDate;
```solidity// Compliant: Clear financial terms
      contract LoanAgreement {
          address public lender;
          address public borrower;
          uint256 public principal;
          uint256 public repaymentAmount;
          uint256 public dueDate;
```
