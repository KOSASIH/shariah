26. Equitable risk distribution:
    - The contract should ensure that risks are shared equitably among the parties.
    - Example: A joint venture where one party bears all the financial risk while the other party benefits from profits without any risk.
    - Solidity Example:
      ```solidity
      // Compliant: Equitable risk distribution
      contract JointVenture {
          address public partner1;
          address public partner2;
          uint256 public capital1;
          uint256 public capital2;
          uint256 public profitShare1;
          uint256 public profitShare2;
```solidity// Compliant: Equitable risk distribution
      contract JointVenture {
          address public partner1;
          address public partner2;
          uint256 public capital1;
          uint256 public capital2;
          uint256 public profitShare1;
          uint256 public profitShare2;
```
