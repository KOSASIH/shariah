    - Solidity Example:
      ```solidity
      // Not compliant: Conventional insurance contract
      contract ConventionalInsurance {
          address public insured;
          address public insurer;
          uint256 public premium;
```solidity// Not compliant: Conventional insurance contract
      contract ConventionalInsurance {
          address public insured;
          address public insurer;
          uint256 public premium;
