45. Ethical partnership structures (musharakah and mudarabah):
    - Partnerships should be structured ethically, with clear terms on profit and loss sharing.
    - Example: A mudarabah (investment partnership) where the investor unfairly dictates terms that minimize their risk while exposing the manager to higher risk.
    - Solidity Example:
      ```solidity
      // Compliant: Ethical partnership structures
      contract Mudarabah {
          address public investor;
          address public manager;
          uint256 public investmentAmount;
          uint256 public profitShareInvestor;
          uint256 public profitShareManager;
```solidity// Compliant: Ethical partnership structures
      contract Mudarabah {
          address public investor;
          address public manager;
          uint256 public investmentAmount;
          uint256 public profitShareInvestor;
          uint256 public profitShareManager;
```
